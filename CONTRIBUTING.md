# Contributing Guidelines

Some general philosophy and rules of thumb:

+ Patches and updates should be submitted as pull requests, and reviewed by peers
+ **Tests** should always be included
+ Changes to the API should be discussed in Issues or your Pull Request prior
to merging into master

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/500px/gunter.git
